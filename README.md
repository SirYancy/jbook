# jbook

[Live Example](https://siryancy.github.io/jbook/)

This is an app that allows users to test code and write notes in a web browser. It's mostly useful as a demonstration of in-browser bundling of JavaScript, however, since it keeps no permanent state (future?).

For now, you'll notice that it is capable of rendering two types of panels. One is a code editor that will execute arbitrary JavaScript code, including importing from NPM (execute arbitrary code at your own risk). The other panel is a Markdown panel which will render any markdown code that you type in the left pane.

I hope you enjoy!
